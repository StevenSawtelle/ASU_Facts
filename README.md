Created based off the template found at https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-fact - this is an Alexa skill hosted on AWS that triggers off of a lambda function. For reference, the particularly useful file found here is in src/index.js, with the others being largely support files. Thanks to Mark Tucker for help creating the images used as the logo. Feel free to submit a pull request with additional facts, corrects, or anything else.
